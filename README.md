A toy, starting with Spark Streaming + Kafka

Intial start based on info gleaned from:

- [ampcamp exercise](http://ampcamp.berkeley.edu/3/exercises/realtime-processing-with-spark-streaming.html)
- [general Spark Streaming guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/streaming-programming-guide.html)
- [Spark Streaming Kafka Integration guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/streaming-kafka-0-10-integration.html)

The above is sufficient for the general kinds of operations available within the Spark ecosystem, including [GraphX](https://spark.apache.org/graphx/) ops and whatnot. One really interesting tie-in would be using neural networks within this context though. See:

- in conjunction with [Debo Datta's blog](http://debajyotidatta.github.io/nlp/deep/learning/word-embeddings/2016/11/27/Understanding-Convolutions-In-Text/)
